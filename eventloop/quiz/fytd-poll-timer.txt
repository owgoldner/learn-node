- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

someAsyncOperation is executed first since it is a pending callback queued once the readFile worker thread is finished
Then the timeout function is called after the pending callback. The order is the same if we change
the while loop delay because the pending callback scheduled once the poll event is complete
takes priority over any timer callbacks.
However, when we change the timeout to 0 the timer callback is moved to pending and is executed first because the worker thread reading
the file hasn't finished yet, so the someAsyncOperation log hasn't been added to pending callbacks yet.
