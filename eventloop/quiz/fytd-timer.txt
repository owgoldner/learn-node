- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The main thread outputs foo baz foo baz, while bar(2) and bar(1) are added to the timers queue.
Once the main thread is done, we go to the event loop and since there is no I/O to poll, the bar
calls are moved to the pending callbacks and then executed. So, the full order is:
foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar
