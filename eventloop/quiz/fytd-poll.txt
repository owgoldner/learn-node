- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

readFile is called first but it is async, so it is completed on a worker thread and
its result is sent to pending callbacks.
foo and done are logged in order as part of the main thread, and then Read Error is 
logged once the event loop starts and pending callbacks are cleared.

output:
foo
done
Read Error
